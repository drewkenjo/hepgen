##### HOMEPAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please always check our website for the latest information about HEPGen++

https://na58-project-tgeant.web.cern.ch/content/hepgen



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation is straight-forward cmake-guided.
You will need at least a working GCC and cmake > 2.6


To install HEPGen++ do the following:

#if you want to use root, set ROOTSYS
export ROOTSYS=`root-config --prefix`
#do this anyway
cd HEPGen++
mkdir build 
mkdir install 
cd build 
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make && make install


This will detect automatically if you are having ROOT installed and ready. 
If so it will enable ROOT-histograms in addition to the ASCII-Histograms 
that you will be getting anyway.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### ADDITIONAL CMAKE FLAGS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -DHEPGEN_DISABLE_ROOT=YES	 disables ROOT support even if it was found
  -DHEPGEN_EVDISGL=YES 		 enables the build of the hepgen opengl event display evDis
			         needs Qt4 and OpenGl

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### USAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

make sure you add the lib-folder to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/PATH/TO/HEPGEN_INSTALL/lib


Then use hepgen as a normal command-line-like utility:
HEPGen++ [PATH_TO_CONFIG] [SEED_TO_USE]
e.g.
./HEPGen++ hepgen_dvcs.data 42 


If you have installed NCurses (and not ROOT6 as of yet, see: https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=20705)
you can also use:
./HEPGenCurses++ hepgen_dvcs.data 42
Note that this is still a bit experimental

To get the full help:
./HEPGen++ -h

This will generate the output-files in lepto-format like:
HEPGen++-outfile-YYYY-MM-DD.HH:MM:SS-[SEED]_binary.bin
And histogram-files:
For ASCII:
HEPGen++-histograms-YYYY-MM-DD.HH:MM:SS-[SEED].dat
For ROOT:
HEPGen++-histograms-YYYY-MM-DD.HH:MM:SS-[SEED].root

You can set the OUTFILE parameter in the datacard to override this feature.
If you set this parameter, you get a predictable file-name for batch-production



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### HELP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a C++-Port of the original-HEPGen software developed by
Andrzej Sandacz in Fortran. 

If you encounter any bugs or serious installation issues feel free to contact
me at christopher.regali@cern.ch or the whole TGEANT@cern.ch list.

1.0-RC3-04 12.4.2016
  * Added libGKPi0 and cache-table with full twist-3 transv. implementation of the GK Model for Pi0 production
  * Cleaned up the resources 


1.0-RC2-03 21.1.2016
  * Fixed several problems with incorrectly set parameters in the config files
  * Added the possibility to enable / disable histograms
  * Fixed weight adding in the phi generator

1.0-RC1-02 24.11.2015
  * Added LST(24) = 1 if event was DD, 0 if event was 'elastic'
  * Added weightCounting only if event was not a DD event


1.0-RC1-01 18.11.2015
  * Added lumiCalc cross section integration tool - needs ROOT
  * Fixed cross sections of Rho0,Phi,Omega that were wrong with a factor of 25
  * Updated documentation
  * Added a ncurses based executable (buggy with ROOT6!)
  * Added a cout for sum of weights for all  generators


0.9-RC3-03 14.7.2015
  * Changed format for data tables for pi0 and rho+
    - New tables are self-sustained and need no hardcoded dimensions
    - New names are *_ng.dat for this format

0.9-RC3-02 12.7.2015
  * Added pixel/vertex shading to OpenGL event display
  * Added -leptofile option to OpenGL event display

0.9-RC3-01 7.7.2015
  * Fixed some angular problems with the H. Moutarde Code and doubled conversionfactor application (Thanks A. Vidon)
  * Added an OpenGl event display that can be activated with -DHEPGEN_EVDISGL=YES (needs Qt4 and OpenGl)

0.9-RC2-01 30.6.2015
  * Fixed the phase factors for the Q^2 generation
    * Note: This broke binary compatibility with hepgen!
  * Added PAM-BH generator (Thanks A. Vidon)
  * Fixed a small bug in the lepto reader library regarding the header-length checks

0.8-RC1-01 27.5.2015
  * Fixed  a beamfile problem (thanks A. Ferrero)
  * Added omega and rho+ generator
  * Added pi0 transversity cx table
  * Fixed a small bug in the computation of S (thanks P. Joerg)
  * Added VGG-DVCS generator ala L. Mosse (needs ROOT installed)
  * Added generalized functions for CX computation from phast "HEPGen++ in PHAST"

0.7-RC3-04 24.6.2014
  * Fixed a bug in dd that some protons still got the wrong status code

0.7-RC3-03 14.6.2014
  * Fixed a bug that some protons, when dd is enabled but does not happen, get the wrong statuscode
  * Fixed a bug that the dvcs-generator would not run on some compilers due to undefined return code
  
0.7-RC3-02 14.3.2014
  * Fixed another CMakeLists.txt bug for SLC6

0.7-RC3-01 11.3.2014
  * Changed the name completely to HEPGen++
  * Replaced the findROOT.cmake with a version that works on SLC5
  * Fixed the nasty CMP-12 bug in the CMakeLists that annoyed the SLC5-Users

0.7-RC2-02 10.3.2014
  * Fixed a small Rollover-Flaw in which one element from the beamfile was not read

0.7-RC2-01 7.3.2014
  * Added ASCII-2d-Histogramming for those that dont want to use root
  * Fixed a generation-flaw in charged-particles of DD. Should look good now

0.7-RC1-01 5.3.2014
  * Added an outfile-option in the datacard for generating reliable file-names to be used in scripts afterwards
  * Added diffractive dissociation (DD) - still in testing stage

  * Added a simple Phi->K K generator. The weights are approximated after the same paper, where the rho->pi pi approximation came from
  * Thanks to Arne Gross for his contribution here

0.5-RC1-01 7.10.2013:
  * Fixed a big bug in 0.4 that killed the events when beamfile was NOT loaded. Now loading and not-loading should work in all generators
  * Added a major part of doxygen-documentation
  
0.4-RC1-01 7.10.2013:
  * Made all features available via data-cards, not so many cmd-line-features to be used by now
  * Added the functionality for isoscalar targets - still not enabled by default datacards though

0.3-RC1-02 1.10.2013:

  * Added feature for auto-detection of headerlength in beamfiles
  
0.3-RC1-01 1.10.2013:

0.2-RC1-03 8.4.2013:

0.2-RC1-02 3.4.2013:
  * Added a GFortran compatibility mode for the lepto output format where the headers are put in 64-bit length. One can toggle it by using the gfortran flag as described above
